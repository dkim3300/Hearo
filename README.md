## App Functionality

hearo is an app designed to solve the problems that arise from hearing aid failures. This tool provides accessibilty and functinality in the day to day and promotes independent living in individuals with hearing impairments. 

In the case that an individuals hearing aid fails, this would cause auditory failure seen in communication with others. The app solves this problem by allowing the individual to quickly resolve hearing failures through means of a visual speech to text stream. It lets the user rely on their other senses to make communication still possible.

With a click of a button, the hearo app initilizes a speech to text stream that picks up the communication heard and produces streamed text such that the individual can read it.
